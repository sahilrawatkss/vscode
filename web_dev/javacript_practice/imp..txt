?? operator is used if val is undefined assign anoher value
example:
let x;
x??=5; x is undefined so x new value is 5

-> const variable makes the reference constant not the value

->Javascript numbers are always one type double (64-bit floating point).

->== check only value and not a strict comparison
  === check value and its type also
        eg:x=5  y='5'  x==y true  but x===y false
